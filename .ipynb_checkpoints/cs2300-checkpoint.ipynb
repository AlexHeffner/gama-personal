    "## **Course Description**\n",
    "CS 2300 - Computer Programming in Java is a stand-alone course in the computer science cirriculum here at Ohio University intended for students who want to learn more about computer programming for their use in unrelated fields. Meaning CS 2300 is not a required course for computer science majors, but rather for students in other majors who want to further their skills in computer programming. As a student in this course you will learn the basics of programming in Java, representing data, debugging and verifying programs, and also dive into the organization and charactersitics of computers. If you're not sure if you want to declare computer science as your major right away, this would be the perfect first class to take to learn more about the basics of computer programming and much more computing related topics."
