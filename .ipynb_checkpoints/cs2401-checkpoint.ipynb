    "## **Course Description**\n",
    "CS 2401 will be a continuation of the programming that you will learn about in CS 2400, but with a concentration on the development of larger projects and the design process. In this class, you will be looking at the different ways that classes can hold data in ways that are versatile and useful, including dynamic arrays, linked lists, and inheritance - which is a powerful feature in object-oriented programming. Other topics  include design of software using UML, generic programming (templates), stacks, queues, container classes and iterators, derived classes, virtual functions, and polymorphism. During the final weeks of this class, you will be developing a single big project, which will be some type of board game.  This will be a program where the computer will play an “intelligent” game against a human opponent. It will be while you are working on your game that you will also learn about recursion and binary trees."

    "\n",
    "These examples cover 4 important concepts that will covered in CS 2401. The first example is about a commonly used data stucture called a binary treee. The next example intruduces you to recursion - when a function makes a call to itself. The third example shows you how to store data in a structure called a linked list. Finally, the last example is about an important concept called inheritance"

    "### **Binary Trees and Traversals**\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, a binary tree is a special kind of data structure used to store data in an efficient way. Each 'node' in a binary tree contains a value, and has pointers containing values of two children - a left child, and a right child. In a binary search tree, the left child's value is less than its parent, and the right child's value is greater than its parent. Binary search trees are a type of binary tree used for sorting and searching numbers in a quick way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of a binary tree implemented in C++. There are 3 ways to traverse through a binary tree - inorder, preorder, and postorder. View the diagrams and the code to see how each traversal works: "
