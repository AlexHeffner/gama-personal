    "## **What You'll Learn**\n",
    "In mathematics, a matrix (plural matrices) is a rectangular array or table of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns, which is used to represent a mathematical object or a property of such an object. This kind of mathematical representation will be used many times throughout the computer science curriculum here at Ohio University and is used in a variety of different ways.\n",
    "In this first example you are going to learn about basic matrix operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication. This is fundamental to this class because you will be working with matrices throughout the entire class. Secondly you are going to learn about Gaussian elimination which is a technique that is used to solve linear equations. Solving linear equations can apply to a number of different problems and will prove to be useful to you in a number of situations.\n",

    "To start off to see if we can add two matrices together, we will first need to check to see if the two matrices have the same dimensions otherwise, we are not able to add them together. To add the matrices we will add the correspond elements in each matrices together to get the summed matrices.\n",

    "For matrix multiplication we do something a bit differnt. Fisrt we must check the correct dimmeniosn. Let's say that matrix A has a dimmension n x m, n being number of rows and m being number of colmuns. To muliplt a second matrix B to this one we will have to choose a matrix that had m rows and any number of columns. Lets say our second matrix B will have the dimmenisons i x j, i being number of rows and j being number of columns. For matrix A to be multipled to matrix B, i will have to be the same number as m.\n",

    "Our resulting matrix will end up being a size of n x j, This will make more sense after we step through the muliplicaton process.\n",

    "How do we calculate the resulted matrix? For a single element in the resulting matrix we will want to find the sum of the products of every element in matrix A row multipled by the correspoding elements in the column of matrix B. So if we wanted to find element for row one column one of our resulting matrix we would take each element in row 1 of A and mulitply it by the correspoing element in column 1 of matrix B, then sum up all of the products to get our final answer for element the first element of the first row. if we were looking at row 1 and column 2 of the resulting matrix then we would use row 1 of A and column 2 in B. This process will be done until each element of the resulting matrix is full. Down below is an example of this.\n",

    "In mathematics, Gaussian elimination is an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. Systems of linear equations can show up in many places anywhere from investing to planning direction routes, to decided on pulling out a loan. Gauessin elminiation takes a system of equations and represents the coiffectis(including the ansewers) in a matrix and solves the system of equations by appling differnt row operations. There are three main row operations we can use.\n",

At the end we will want reduced row echelon form which will follow all of the rules already stated but that the first coefficent in each row must be a 1.\n",

    "In this notebook, you have learned about basic matrix arithmatic like addition, subtraction, and mulitiplication which is fundemental and helps solve problems in many areas. You have also learned how to perform guassian elimination. This is specific way of solving linear equations. These are some of the fundemental topics that you will learn in the class. Knowing how to manipulate matrices and use them to represent real world applications can help you solve so many problems in computer science. After taking this class you will not be reqired to take any more math classes and you can feel confindednt that you have this math knowlage needed for Ohio universitys computer science ciriculum."
