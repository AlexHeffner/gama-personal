    "This class is an Introduction to microcontrollers and their architecture. You will learn many differnt things assembly language; timing analysis of assembly language programs; digital input/output (I/O); in-depth discussion on the use of built-in peripheral devices such as timers, analog-to-digital converters, EEPROM storage devices, capture/compare/PWM, and parallel and serial communication devices; serial communication includes both synchronous communication (SPI, I2C) and asynchronous (USART) communication; introduction to systems of networked microcontrollers; advanced fixed-point arithmetic on a microcontroller.\n",

    "In this class you will learn how to program a UART in which you will learn about assembly language and interrupts to utilize different aspects of a microcontroller. \n",
    "\n",
    "In assembly you learn to make use of the Arithmetic logic unit to add subtract, Memory management, register manipulation, utilizing different ports, communication between different ports and much more.\n",
