    "## **Course Description**\n",
    "MATH 2301 (Calc I) is the first course in calculus and analytic geometry with applications in the sciences and engineering. This class includes basic techniques of differentiation and integration with applications including rates of change, optimization problems, and curve sketching - including exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric functions. Using hand-held calculators is optional and not necessary to do the writing assignments, but you may use them to do calculations and to check your work. Calculators are not required and may not be used on examinations. Each lesson contains one or more reading assignments and a writing assignment, which you are to submit for evaluation."

    "### **Introduction To Limits**\n",
    "In mathematics, a limit is defined as a value approaching the output of the given input values by a function. In calculus and mathematical analysis, the limit is important and it is used to describe integrals, derivatives, and continuity. It is used in the research process and is often concerned with the function’s behavior. Assume we have an f(x) function. The value, a function, arrives with the variable x reaching a given value, meaning that the variable a is referred to as its limit. Here, a is an initial value. It’s labeled as lim x ⇢ a f(x) = 1 "

    "Substitution is a method of determining limits where the value that x is approaching is substituted into the function and the result is evaluated. An asymptote is a line on the graph of a function representing a value toward which the function may approach, but does not reach (with certain exceptions)."

    "as a work of art. A full presentation of calculus requires three one-semester courses. Because many of the most important mathematical methods in the life sciences are calculus-based, it is important to know some calculus in order to proceed and succeed here at Ohio University. In this module we just began to scratch the surface by studying various techniques of solving limits in Calc I. "
