    "## **Course Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "CS 2400 is one of the first and most exciting courses new computer science students will take here at Ohio University! In this course you will dive into a bunch of different topics that are programming related, and really get a grasp of what programming is and what it takes to be a programmer. Early in the course you will learn about the basic concepts of the C++ programming language. Some of these concepts include: data types, variables, loops, flow of control, and even creating functions. Even though to some, these topics may seem elementary, understanding these concepts like the back of your hand is crucial for becoming a successful CS student in the future. The difficulty begins to increase in the second half of the course when topics are covered like: objects, classes, dynamic memory, polymorphism, and abstract data types. Learning and applying these concepts may be challenging, but this class is one of the most favored by CS students because of the challenge, and how much you will learn when you apply yourself. CS 2400 is a project-based course so, you will do a decent amount of programming on your own. Also, there are weekly labs to apply the skills you learned in class in an open environment where questions are encouraged.\n"

    "\n",
    "Many of the core coding & programming concepts are introduced in CS 2400. Our first example is about data types in C++. In computer science, a data type is \"an attribute of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data\". Our second example is about loops, and our third example is about making functions. These two concepts are very important and commonly used. Finaly, our last example involves control flow - making variales and if-else statements."
