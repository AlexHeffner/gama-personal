    "## **Course Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "CS 3200, Organization of Programming Languages, is a hands-on introduction to the science of programming and programming languages. This class includes many topics such as: structured data and pattern-matching, recursive and polymorphic data, recursion and higher-order functions, lazy evaluation and streams, automated and equational reasoning about programs, concrete and abstract syntax, grammars, interpreters, desugaring, types and type-checking, type safety, mutable state, references, and objects. Over the course of the semester, you will build interpreters and type checkers for a series of increasingly complex languages. We will cover just a few of these topics in this notebook."
