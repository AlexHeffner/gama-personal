    "### **Packet Capture**\n",
    "What is a packet capture? A Packet Capture is a capturing Internet Protocol packets for analysis. Capturing packets is a common troubleshooting technique for network administrators, and is also used to examine network traffic for security threats. If there happened to be a data breach packets can provide very important information in finding out what happened and how it happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "This next example is taken from https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/analyze-wi-fi-data-captures-with-jupyter-notebook-0201490/ where they used Wireshark to gather the data. Wireshark is a common packet capture tool used by many network administrators. In the example they used they studied a packet capture where client Wi-Fi devices had their real MAC addresses unmasked by fake networks. Fake networks are networks that are meant to imitate real public networks such as a Starbucks Wi-Fi. They are set up by hackers to steal your personal information. Generally, most devices will not reveal their true MAC address unless they find a trusted network. In the example below they were able to get into this trusted network category by using fake networks to fingerprint client devices to find out which networks they have connected to before. This can be thought of brute-forcing the \"Preferred network list\" stored inside peopleâ€™s phones when looking for a network to connect to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example they were able to use real data that was taken from a Red Line Metro train riding from Wilshire & Vermont to Hollywood & Highland during rush hour. The tools used were ESP8266 with the \"Beacon Spammer\", Arduino sketch and a list of common Wi-Fi network names, and lastly Wireshark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Down below you can see how we can gather all differnt kinds of information from this data."
