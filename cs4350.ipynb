    "## **Course Description**\n",
    "This course provides an introduction to various aspects of game engine design. Topics include: audio, physics, networking, importing multimedia, terrain formats, GUIs, voice communications, virtual reality, and optimization techniques, with an emphasis on build systems and integration of third party libraries. Students will be able to describe the necessary sub-systems for a game engine and will be able to explain how to integrate multiple software libraries into a single project. Also, after completing this class, you will learn how to identify various common formats for multimedia in software projects and will learn how to design an interface usable by a third party to drive an application. You will be able to collect digital elevation models and orthoimagery from various public sources to incorporate into software projects. Finally, you will articulate how to implement a software project containing features such as audio, physics, or multiplayer collaboration."

    "## **What You'll Learn**\n",
    "One programming concept that is critical to a way that a game engine functions, is inheritence. Inheritance allows programmers to create classes that are built upon existing classes, to specify a new implementation while maintaining some of the same behaviors. In create a game engine, you want some parts to have some of the same functionalities as others, and inheritence is an efficient way to do that. In this class, you will write code using inheritence.\n",
    "### **Inheritence in C++**\n",
    "In this first example, inheritence is explained in an easy-to-understand way. A class is created for a vehicle, and a class is created for a four wheeler. Then, a car class is created, which inherits all of the functions of the vehicle AND four wheeler classes. Run the following code snipits to view the result.\n",

    "This example should complete your understanding of inheritence. A class is created for \"shape\", containing functions of setWidth and setHeight. Another class is created for \"PaintCost\", which has a function that calculates the cost for a given paint job based on the area. Finally, a \"Rectangle\" class is created, inheriting from the shape and PaintCost classes, since a rectangle is both a shape and has a corresponding cost of painting.
