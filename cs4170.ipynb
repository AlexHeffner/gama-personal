    "## **Course Description**\n",
    "CS 4170 - Data Mining with Applications in the Life Sciences is a computer science elective offered here at Ohio University that is often taken by undergraduate students in their third or fourth year. If you have ever had any interest in mining data or working with data to solve complex problems, CS 4170 would be the perfect course to take to learn more about it. Students in this course will design and develop their own custom software to solve real-world life science problems. Some of the topics students will cover in this course include: processing DNA sequences and protein sequences, restriction maps, data pipelines, and the Entrez programming utilities. In this class, you will learn about data classification (decision trees and random forests), association rule mining, and data cleaning. CS 4170 is an extremely interesting course where students will learn various data mining techniques to help solve modern problems in the life sciences."
