    "EE 1024 will be every student in computer science's first introduction into the basics of computer enginneering. This course will build your knowledge on exactly how computers operate at their lowest level possible. You will learn how computers process data and how they convert numbers to various bases including (decimal, binary, and hexadecimal). Another important topic you will cover in this class is logic and how computers make decisions. As a students in this course you will learn all about Boolean Algebra, Binary Arithmetic, and the charactersistics of Logic Gates which are the building blocks of Computers and Computer Engineering. All students are also required to participate in lab for this course where you can real hands-on experience working with the topics that are taught in lecture."

    "Decimal Notation is the most common way to express numbers. This is the way we normally express numbers in our normal everyday lives. Decimal notation is considered to be expressing numbers in a base 10 format. For example, when we write a normal (base 10) number, like 7938, we mean the value: 7000 + 900 + 80 + 3. To put this in a more revealing form, we can do: (7 * 10^3) + (9 * 10^2) + (8 * 10^1) + (3 * 10^0). Notice that the digits of our number correspond to coefficients on the powers of 10 that our added together to obtain the value of our number.\n",
